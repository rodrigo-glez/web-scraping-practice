# Books to Scrape - Simple Web Scraping Practice

This is a beginner-friendly exercise to practice web scraping and data wrangling.

Using requests and BeautifulSoup, I scraped book information from [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com), a sandbox website designed for practicing scraping.

Data collected per book:

- Title
- Price
- Rating (converted to numeric scale)
- Availability (converted to 1 = in stock, 0 = out of stock)

The data was cleaned and stored in a Pandas DataFrame for basic exploration.

While the dataset is randomized and not suited for deep analysis, this project helped me practice:

- Navigating HTML with BeautifulSoup
- Handling multiple pages of results
- Transforming raw scraped values into structured, analyzable data
